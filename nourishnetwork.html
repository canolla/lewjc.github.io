                In 2023, New Zealand grocery prices were skyrocketing. This meant a lot more people who hadn't experienced food insecurity were having to reach out for support, but reaching out can be a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
                <p>
                This inspired the creation of Nourish Network, an enterprise whose aim is to bring the community together to create a network of people, including farmers, who have surplus vegetables, eggs, milk, and other produce to distribute for people to collect from.

                            Secondly, at the beginning of 2023, fruit and vege prices increased by 22%. Finally, New Zealand's yearly food waste produces over 409,000 metric tonnes of carbon emissions.

                            <p>Then I developed two primary personas to further empathise and understand the target audiences and their painpoints.

The second persona is Corey, he's a farmer who supplies local businesses with produce, but he's often left with surplus produce which goes to landfill.</p>

                <p>The UX/UI process began with gathering layout inspiration, creating sitemaps, wireframing, and lofi prototyping. In this stage I was getting a general layout for the website and how different features would be laid out.
                From what I had learned through user testing, it was essential to make browsing the site straight forward and as simple as possible for anyone to use the site freely. </p>

                <p>So I developed the Hi-Fi prototype with a homepage which aims to explain who Nourish Network is, what it does, and then guide the user to the map where they can discover Nourish Network locations. I also made the Become a Distributor page for those who wish to distribute produce, and a donate option for those who want to support the cause.</p>

                    After the prototyping process, with the user testing feedback I'd gained, I was able to move on to developing the website. I developed the website in VS Code using HTML/CSS/JS. I also connected Google Maps API to create a map of food distributors for users to browse through.</p>
